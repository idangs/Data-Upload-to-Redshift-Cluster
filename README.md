# Data-Upload-to-Redshift-Cluster
This project contains a program that uploads files to the Amazon Redshift Cluster. This program allows the user to upload one or multiple files to the cluster and stores each file as a table in the database. This is useful for those who want to automate uploading files to redshift.
